Lab 04 - Playing with Common Sensors
Working in groups of 4 or 5, pick one of the sensors below from your kit. To find out more about each one google the sensor + the magic word datasheet. Also, sensor + Arduino is a useful one. Hook it up and be prepared to explain to the class how to works next week. Most can also be built on Tinkercad.

Sensors in your kit to explore:

PIR Motion Sensor

Ultrasonic Sensor

IR LED / IR Receiver

Light Dependent Resistor

TMP36 Temperature Sensor (there are 3 of these, go wild)

Tilt Sensor
